## Introduction

Gold price prediction is a significant area of research in the financial domain. This project uses historical data to create models that can predict future gold prices. The features used for training include market trends, currency exchange rates, economic indicators, and more.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zaree444/Gold-price-Forecasting-.git
    cd Gold-price-Forecasting-
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is available in the `data/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to the notebook file and run the cells to execute the code and see the results.

## Models

This project uses the following machine learning algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model to predict future prices based on historical data.
- **Decision Trees**: A model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction.

## Results

The results of the models, including accuracy metrics and visualizations, are documented in the Jupyter Notebooks. You can compare the performance of different models and see which one performs best for gold price prediction.
